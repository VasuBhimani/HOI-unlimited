- **Orchestration with AWS EKS** ☸️: Kubernetes clusters are deployed and managed on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** 🏗️: Terraform is used for provisioning and managing infrastructure resources.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** 🔄: GitHub Actions is leveraged to automate build, test, and deployment workflows.
- **Code Quality and Security** 🛡️:
  - **SonarQube** 🔍: Integrated for code quality and static analysis.
  - **Trivy** 🔎: Used for vulnerability scanning of Docker images and Kubernetes clusters.
- **Notifications** 💬: Slack notifications are configured to alert about pipeline updates, security scans, and other critical events.
- **Shell Scripting** 📜: Various scripts are included to automate repetitive tasks and enhance project efficiency.

## 💻 Technology Stack

- **HTML (50.2%)** 🌐: Used for front-end components or documentation.
- **Python (31%)** 🐍: For scripting, automation, or application logic.
- **HCL (9.8%)** 📝: For defining infrastructure configurations via Terraform.
- **Shell (7.1%)** 📟: For automation scripts.
- **Dockerfile (1.9%)** 📦: For building Docker images.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions to manage EC2 instances and EKS clusters.
- Terraform installed on the EC2 instance or virtual machine.
- SonarQube and Trivy set up on the EC2 instance or virtual machine.
- Slack workspace for receiving notifications.

### 🔧 Installation and Deployment

All setup and deployment are performed **on EC2 instances or virtual machines**. There is no need to install tools on your local machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** 📂:
   - SSH into your EC2 instance or virtual machine.
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/VasuBhimani/HOI-unlimited.git
     cd HOI-unlimited
     ```

2. **Set up Docker** 🐳:
   - Build Docker images using the provided `Dockerfile`.
   - Run containers as specified in the documentation.

3. **Deploy to AWS EKS** ☁️:
   - Use the Terraform configuration files to provision the EKS cluster.
   - Apply the Terraform scripts:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     terraform apply
     ```

4. **Configure CI/CD with GitHub Actions** 🔄:
   - Ensure your repository secrets (e.g., AWS credentials, SonarQube tokens, Slack Webhook URL) are configured in GitHub.
   - Review the `.github/workflows` directory for pipeline configurations.

5. **Set up SonarQube and Trivy** 🛡️:
   - Install and configure SonarQube on the EC2 instance for static code analysis.
   - Use Trivy for vulnerability scanning in Docker images and Kubernetes clusters.

6. **Configure Slack Notifications** 📢:
   - Set up a Slack Webhook and integrate it with the CI/CD pipelines for real-time alerts.

## 🔍 Usage

- **Development** 👨‍💻: Use the EC2 instance or virtual machine as your development environment.
- **Deployment** 🚢: Deploy applications to AWS EKS using the CI/CD pipelines.
- **Code Quality and Security** 🔒: Run SonarQube and Trivy checks to ensure code and infrastructure security.
- **Notifications** 📱: Receive updates and alerts via Slack for pipeline and scanning results.
